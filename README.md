## SWEET - Smart Wallet Tech
(evolved from CosmWasm Starter Pack)

## SWEET - Smart Wallet Engine for 'Everybody' Technology)
While techno enthusiasts learn more and more complex instruments and technologies, many ordinary people are being forgotten who could also benefit from some of the advantages of decentralised technologies.  The motivation of SWEET is to produce applications which are focused on everyday, non-tech savvy users - obfuscating all the complications so they can get the benefits: just like with the internet. SWEET can do the heavy lifting for apps such as the eponymous "Joint Smart Wallet", which allows households to manage share assets under fixed rules, without having to handle or deal with normal wallets.

## Built in Rust with CosmWasm
SWEET (in this early version) consists of a smart contract written in Rust using the CosmWasm suite.  The smart contract essentially acts as a governed vault. It maintains the rules and parameters in its own state, which users can set up via the off-chain app.  Once instantiated, each member of the group uses their own "smart wallet" to access the funds according to rules agreed in the contract, using cryptographic keys which are obfuscated from the user and managed via either passphrase, biometrics or a combination.  Although the first demonstration app uses the more common abstracts of "couples", "parent and child", etc., arbitrary groups can use the app to group their assets. In a future in which multiple assets may one day exist in token form, there is no limit to use cases.
